    #{@shortdoc}

    `BB.Servo.Robotis.Actuator` no longer takes a `reverse?` option, and no
    longer derives a `center_angle` from joint limits. Both pieces of
    behaviour have moved into the joint-level `transmission` block in BB.

    This upgrader rewrites every robot module in the project: for each
    actuator with `BB.Servo.Robotis.Actuator` as its driver, it removes
    `reverse?:` from the actuator's options and inserts a `transmission`
    block on the parent joint when `reverse?: true` was present and/or the
    joint's limits were asymmetric (so that `(lower + upper) / 2` is the
    angle the servo's hardware centre used to map to).
