    #{@shortdoc}

    `BB.Servo.Robotis.Actuator` no longer takes a `reverse?` option, and no
    longer derives a `center_angle` from joint limits. Both pieces of
    behaviour have moved into a per-attachment `transmission` block in BB.

    This upgrader rewrites every robot module in the project: for each
    actuator with `BB.Servo.Robotis.Actuator` as its driver, it removes
    `reverse?:` from the actuator's options and nests a `transmission`
    block inside the actuator's own do/end when `reverse?: true` was
    present and/or the joint's limits were asymmetric (so that `(lower +
    upper) / 2` is the angle the servo's hardware centre used to map to).
    It also handles re-running from older versions where the transmission
    sat at the joint level: any joint-level `transmission` block is moved
    into the matching actuator.
